persistent-vector
=======


A persistent vector implementation based on [these](http://hypirion.com/musings/understanding-persistent-vector-pt-1) [series] (http://hypirion.com/musings/understanding-persistent-vector-pt-2)
of [blog](http://hypirion.com/musings/understanding-persistent-vector-pt-3) posts, and heavily influenced by @graue's
[immutable-vectors](https://github.com/graue/immutable-vector).

Note: I built this just to learn it. It's nothing more than a scratchpad of ideas at this point.
